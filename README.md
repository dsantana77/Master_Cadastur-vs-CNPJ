The creation of the Location Service for Companies, requiring registration with Cadastur, is deemed a crucial initiative for the Brazilian tourism industry. This service aims to enhance legality, quality, and safety in the sector by addressing challenges such as identifying unregistered companies, improving registration processes, and contributing to economic development. The lack of clear information about company locations hampers trust in establishments, causes inefficiencies in local tourism projects, results in disconnected statistics, and poses difficulties in selling tourism products effectively. The objectives of the service include identifying unregistered companies, supporting inspection, promoting legality, enhancing tourist security, improving inspection efficiency, encouraging economic development, and contributing to the transparency of Cadastur. The service is expected to generate recommendations and reports for continual updates to Cadastur and guidance for the tourism sector. Overall, implementing this service is considered essential to strengthen the Brazilian tourism sector, ensure tourist safety, and establish a regulated and reliable environment.
