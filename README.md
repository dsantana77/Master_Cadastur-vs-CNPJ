The creation of the Location Service for Companies, requiring registration with Cadastur, is deemed a crucial initiative for the Brazilian tourism industry. This service aims to enhance legality, quality, and safety in the sector by addressing challenges such as identifying unregistered companies, improving registration processes, and contributing to economic development. The lack of clear information about company locations hampers trust in establishments, causes inefficiencies in local tourism projects, results in disconnected statistics, and poses difficulties in selling tourism products effectively. The objectives of the service include identifying unregistered companies, supporting inspection, promoting legality, enhancing tourist security, improving inspection efficiency, encouraging economic development, and contributing to the transparency of Cadastur. The service is expected to generate recommendations and reports for continual updates to Cadastur and guidance for the tourism sector. Overall, implementing this service is considered essential to strengthen the Brazilian tourism sector, ensure tourist safety, and establish a regulated and reliable environment.

The tourism industry plays a significant role in the economy of many countries, generating employment opportunities and driving economic growth. However, for tourism to thrive and reach its full potential, ensuring the quality and safety of services offered to visitors is crucial. In this context, the Registry of Tourism Service Providers in Brazil, also known as Cadastur, emerges as an essential tool for regulating and supervising businesses and professionals operating in the tourism sector.
Cadastur is a mandatory registration system created by the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism to organize and oversee the activities of companies and professionals providing tourism services. It encompasses various segments, including travel agencies, lodging establishments, tour guides, event companies, among others. Registration in Cadastur is a fundamental requirement to ensure the legality of these companies' operations, ensuring compliance with the quality and safety standards demanded by the industry. Cadastur includes both individuals and legal entities involved in the tourism sector (Law 8,623/93 and Law 11,771/2008). Registration is mandatory for tourist camps, travel agencies, tour guides, theme parks, event organizers, lodging facilities, and tourist transport companies, while it is optional for restaurants, cafes, bars, theme parks, leisure ventures, vehicle rental for tourists, specialized providers in tourism segments, entertainment venues, infrastructure providers for events, and convention centers.
In this work, we will develop a Location Service for Companies obligated to register in Cadastur, contributing to providing regulatory agents with a tool to enhance municipal intelligence for locating businesses with mandatory registration. This will aid in effective regulation. We will highlight the importance of this service, its benefits for both tourism service providers and tourists, and its contribution to promoting safer, more reliable, and professional tourism.
Furthermore, we will examine the legal and regulatory consequences associated with Cadastur and how the Location Service plays an essential role in assisting companies and regulatory agents in fulfilling their responsibilities in this scenario. We will address the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing and improving the Location Service for Companies with mandatory registration in Cadastur. Finally, we will present recommendations, reports, and future perspectives for this service, aiming to contribute to a more efficient, transparent, and excellence-driven tourism sector, thereby promoting sustainable tourism growth in Brazil.

The creation of a Location Service for Companies obligated to register with Cadastur emerges as an initiative of utmost importance in the context of the tourism industry in Brazil. This service is supported by various reasons that reflect the pressing need for its implementation:
Promotion of Legality and Quality: Cadastur was established to ensure that companies and professionals in the tourism sector comply with regulations and quality standards. However, the effectiveness of this system depends on the identification and monitoring of companies operating without proper registration. The Location Service will directly contribute to promoting legality by enhancing the quality of tourism services, identifying those not undergoing the necessary registration, and providing mandatory information to government agencies.
Enhancement of Oversight: Regulatory bodies face significant challenges in identifying and monitoring companies obligated to register with Cadastur, especially in a country with continental dimensions like Brazil. The Location Service will provide an effective tool to assist regulatory agents in promptly locating companies, facilitating compliance with legal obligations.
Improvement of Tourists' Safety and Trust: Safety and reliability of tourism services are critical elements for tourist satisfaction and the promotion of tourism. Unregistered companies may pose risks to visitors as they are not subject to the same checks and regulations as registered entities. The Location Service will contribute to a safer environment, where tourists can trust in the quality of services offered.
Stimulation of Economic Development: The tourism industry has the potential to drive economic growth by creating jobs and generating revenue for local communities. However, this contribution depends on the existence of a regulated and reliable environment. The Location Service will help identify and support compliant businesses, stimulating sectoral growth.
Reduction of Inefficiencies: The lack of clear information about the location of registered and unregistered companies can lead to inefficiencies in oversight and law enforcement. The Location Service will eliminate bureaucratic obstacles and facilitate informed decision-making by responsible authorities, resulting in more effective oversight.
Therefore, the implementation of the Location Service for Companies with mandatory registration in Cadastur is crucial to strengthen the tourism sector, protect tourists' interests, promote compliance with regulations, and contribute to Brazil's economic development, all while ensuring the safety and quality of services provided to visitors. This service is a direct response to the challenges currently faced in overseeing the tourism sector and promoting responsible and sustainable tourism.

The Location Service for Companies in the tourism sector that could register with Cadastur, whether obligated or not, has the primary objective of contributing to the improvement of regulation, safety, and oversight in the Brazilian tourism industry. To achieve this central goal, we have outlined the following specific objectives and expected outcomes:
Identification of Unregistered Companies: The service aims to identify and locate companies operating in the tourism sector without proper registration with Cadastur, providing precise information about their location and activities.
Quality of Registrations: The service aims to identify and locate companies that have encountered issues with the registration process, allowing them to submit additional information or facilitating collaboration with regulatory agencies to complete or adjust data that may be problematic or missing.
Support for Oversight: It is expected that the Location Service will provide significant support to regulatory agents, assisting them in the identification and monitoring of companies obligated to register, facilitating the enforcement of existing regulations and standards.
Promotion of Legality: By identifying unregistered companies and informing relevant authorities, the service will directly contribute to promoting legality in the tourism sector, encouraging companies to fulfill their legal obligations.
Increased Safety for Tourists: The service will help create a safer environment for tourists, as unregistered companies pose potential risks. This will contribute to the protection of visitors and enhance the positive image of Brazilian tourism.
Efficiency in Oversight: The Location Service is expected to optimize oversight resources, reducing inefficiencies and streamlining the process of identifying and monitoring both registered and unregistered companies.
Stimulation of Economic Development: By promoting a more regulated and reliable business environment, the service can stimulate economic growth in the tourism sector, creating job opportunities and boosting local revenue.
Contribution to Cadastur's Transparency and Efficiency: The Location Service will collaborate to make Cadastur more transparent and efficient, ensuring that information about companies and professionals is up-to-date and in compliance with established requirements.
Recommendations and Reports: As a result, the service will generate recommendations and reports to assist in decision-making and the continuous improvement of Cadastur and tourism sector regulations.
In summary, the objectives and expected outcomes of this Location Service are directly aligned with the promotion of safer, legal, and professional tourism in Brazil, benefiting both tourism service providers and tourists. It also contributes to the sustainable growth of the sector. This service will not only assist in oversight and compliance with legal obligations but will also add value to Brazilian tourism, strengthening its position on the international stage.
